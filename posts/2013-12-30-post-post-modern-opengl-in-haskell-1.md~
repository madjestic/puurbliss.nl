Post-Post Modern OpenGL in Haskell
---

For a while my goal was to learn the basics of OpenGL, sufficient for following
the [Haskell School of Expression](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/hudak/SOE/) and just enough to cover the humble requirements
of my theoretic graphics application. A side goal is to keep the code base
as compact and modern as possible, but not avoiding completely the benefitsof using
some syntactic sugar, convenience functions and wrappers, provided by
some modern graphics frameworks.
