## Post-Post Modern OpenGL in Haskell 3 (WIP)
\
\
We continue with introducing basic vertex/fragment shader support, vertex buffer array object.

Parts of the code and module LoadShaders taken from [svenpanne GLUT example files](https://github.com/haskell-opengl/GLUT/blob/master/examples/RedBook8/Chapter01/Triangles.hs)

The code was modified in order to exclude GLUT dependencies.
